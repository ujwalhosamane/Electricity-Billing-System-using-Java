The Simple Electricity Billing System in Java is a learning resource for anyone who wants to enhance their Java knowledge, GUI, and database management using XAMPP skills through a fun, hands-on approach. Using the Apache NetBeans IDE intact with Java Swing and JDBC, there was easy connection with a local database managed through XAMPP. it provides a typically less-sophisticated platform for consumers data input, billing calculation based on the billed tariff, the limited payment registration and recording capabilities. This project doesn't only demonstrate theories behind the development of GUI, database, and software logic through Java, but it also turns out to be a practical education tool for students and enthusiasts of those who are seeking for improving their skills in software development. To focus on the variability and implementations, it is not suitable for production-grade, however it is an excellent tool to understand the core concepts of java application development.

The Log-In Page of the Electricity Billing System acts like a citadel for electricity authorities as well as the customers to access system accordingly. This user authentication interface has been developed using Java Swing in a way that offers not only a secure but also a pleasurable experience of logging in. Administrators are equipped with administrator privileges to such system functions as user data management, system operation with things like billing and system configurations . Meanwhile, customers can provoke to account balance, billing information or payment history.

The login system starts with the credentials screen where users need to enter their credentials which are verified agains the system's database using XAMPP. After authorized usersâ€™ log in to the system, they are directed to the corresponding dashboards according to their role in the process. Administrators get a set of tools and commands to govern the operations of the system of billing electricity, while customer have those means of controlling their accounts and bills.

![Step 3](https://github.com/ujwalhosamane/Random-Resources/blob/main/Electricity%20Billing%20System/Apache%20NetBeans%20IDE%2016%20-%20New%20Project%20(4).png?raw=true)

Copy paste java files in the project directory as shown in above screeshot.

After the above step, add necessary JAR provided in the folder **JAR**.

![Step 4](https://github.com/ujwalhosamane/Random-Resources/blob/main/Electricity%20Billing%20System/Apache%20NetBeans%20IDE%2016%20-%20New%20Project%20(5).png?raw=true)

![Step 5](https://github.com/ujwalhosamane/Random-Resources/blob/main/Electricity%20Billing%20System/Apache%20NetBeans%20IDE%2016%20-%20New%20Project%20(6).png?raw=true)

Add the folder **icon** to the project directory as shown below.

![Step 6](https://github.com/ujwalhosamane/Random-Resources/blob/main/Electricity%20Billing%20System/Apache%20NetBeans%20IDE%2016%20-%20New%20Project%20(7).png?raw=true)

After all the above mentioned steps, run the **Xampp Server** and import the spl file which is provided in the folder **SQL**.

While running the Xampp Server we can run the project as shown in the below screenshot.
